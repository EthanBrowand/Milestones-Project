        <h2>What was the first device similar to a modern computer?</h2>
        <div class="paragraph1">
          The first computer was known as the Analytical Engine which was
          invented by Charles Babbage back in the 19th century. Originally
          Babbage was working on the Difference Engine ,which was practically a
          glorified calculator, but he decided he wanted to improve it. Mainly
          he thought about improving its operation so that it could perform
          other kinds of calculations. He wanted the Analytical Engine to be
          able to perform any calculation it was given. He realised it had to
          have four key components:the mill(cpu), the store(storage & memory),
          and the reader and printer (input and output devices). The project
          was much more complex than any device built before it. In fact it was
          supposed to have more storage than any computer built before 1960.
          Unfortunately, this project was unable to be completed at the time as
          the British Government removed Babbage's funding, and his design was
          judged impossible due to the current technology.
